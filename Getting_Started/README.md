### SOAR Manual
[The SOAR Manual](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/downloads/SoarManual.pdf) contains everything you need to know from syntax to debugger to theory. It is very well written and adds lots of great context to the Wiki course mentioned above. We recommend reading Chapters 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as important introductions to the syntax and usage of the cognitive architecture.
